# pokemonproject

This project entails a collection of html, css, and javascript variations which help interpret my vision of Pokemon. 
I used html and css to build the design of the page while using javascript for the functionability. Javascript helped me
make three AJAX calls to the Pokemon API which were done everytime you click the "About Me" button on each pokemon page. I also incorporated sass to help make the css easier to build. 


This project uses bootstrap to create the evolution grid on each pokemon page.
